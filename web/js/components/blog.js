    <h2> Web Design Experience </h2>
     <p>
        My web development experience is intermediate. 
        I have interned for a company specializing in web 
        development. I used a framework called 
        Laravel. The company interned for would assign me projects
        to style and edit different themes.

     <h2> HomePage Homwork Blog </h2>
      <p> The HomePage Homework assignment I really enjoyed.
          I thought it had just enough content to work on and
          everything was taught clearly. With that being said,
          something valuable I have learned during that assignment
          is how important it is to have reusable code and
          to program in a way that is easy to understand.
          In earlier classes of mine I would program in a very
          pen to paper style where I would just write as much as I can
          to figure out the issue. This assignment has made
          me change my approach to programming.

    <h2> JavaScript UI Blog </h2>
           <p> I thought this homework assignment was very challenging.
           If I may be honest. There was not a lot of work to do.
           But in a way it felt like a lot of information to understand.
           Quite honestly, I was very frustrated doing this assignment
           because of the dropdown menu. To have a responsive
           navigation bar where you can click out of it anywhere
           was very difficult for me to create. I kept working at
           it and eventually did get it to work. It taught me
           to really feel my emotions and sometimes to take a
           step back from my work. With that being said, I also
           learned routing and how beneficial it is to not simply
           call different links in your page using the copy and paste
           method showed in the first tutorial. I am liking how
           my website is coming along.
        </p>
        <h2> "Object Oriented" JavaScript (no jQuery) </h2>
        <p>
            This assignment was difficult but nonetheless. I completed it.
            Js Object will direct you to two pages and the hover will multiply
            the calories by 0.25. You also can change the name, calories, 
            and amount of cookies.

    <h2> HW04: Advanced JS (Slide Show Component)  </h2>
        <p>
            Homework Assignment 04 is the slide show homework using AJAX and
            javascript. This assignment was built up from the lab and quite honestly
            served me a bit of confusion making a public method. I went to office 
            hours and Professor Kyvernitis assisted me in creating an object array
            as well as an optional property. Issues regarding my routing were also
            ironed out. I am glad I went to office hours and got assistance.
        </p>
    <h2> HW05: JS Component (Click Sortable Table)</h2>
        <p>
            Homework Assignment 05 is the click sortable table using AJAX and JSON files.
            I thought I grasped the information pretty well in the lab and that seemed to
            be the case when writing this code. With that being said, I keep running into
            routing errors. Instead of walking away from my website. I kept perservering
            and continued pressing to complete the HW. Before I realized I finished and
            satisfied all the requirements.

    <h2> HW06: Tutorial Proposal</h2>
        <p>
            Homework Assignment 06 is the tutorial proposal. This homework was pretty straight
            forward. All we were asked to do was just write a proposal and create a page on in
            your navigation bar. All in all this was a pretty straight forward homework.
        </p>
    
     <h2> HW07: Database</h2>
        <p>
            Homework Assignment 07 is the database homework. This homework for me was 
            straight forward but there was a lot of error handling. Creating that foreign key
            gave me a plethora of issues that I did seem to expect. But gladly I resolved them
            with a little help from classmates and stack overflow. With all things considered 
            this homework was short (which I am so grateful). My pdf is provided below:
